Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation effects on EEG biomarkers of Motor Vigor (MV) in Parkinson's Disease

we seek answers to the following questions: a) what fraction of the MV variability can be deterministically estimated from the EEG before and during movement? b) Which frequency sub-band(s) contribute most to accurate MV prediction? c) which EEG electrodes are important in terms of MV prediction? d) what effects does GVS have on EEG/MV prediction?
